# Xin AI (心爱) - Your Personal Guide to Emotional Clarity

**Xin AI** is a private, AI-powered web app that helps teens make sense of emotional moments. Get clarity on arguments, awkward texts, or social drama. It's a safe space to get perspective, completely private.

## About The Project

Navigating the social and emotional landscape of teenage years can be tough. It's easy to feel overwhelmed, misunderstood, or to simply overthink a situation. Xin AI was built to be a digital companion for these moments.
It leverages a compassionate AI named **Cayla** to help users:

- **Gain Perspective:** Understand if they are overreacting or if their feelings are justified.
- **Process Emotions:** Talk through situations in a private, non-judgmental space.
- **Communicate Better:** Get suggestions on how to approach difficult conversations.

The entire application is designed with privacy at its core. Conversations are not stored long-term, and there are no user accounts.
